# Animating Characters Programatically in C4

This repository contains the text of my chapter "Animating Characters Programatically in C4" authored for the collaborative educational book, C4 Engine 3D Game Editing & Programming (ISBN-13: 978–0–9887436–0–1), and published by Macktek LLC in 2013.

# Archival

The [C4 Game Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_Engine) is now defunct, however the techniques and general code structure are likely applicable to the game engine's successor, [Tombstone Engine](http://tombstoneengine.com/). The general techniques discussed are also likely applicable to other game engines.

# Where is the text?

The text is available on the "gh-pages" branch.

It can be [read here](https://c4book.github.com/ch28-animation).

**Note:** The text contains some formatting issues as it was exported from a Word document using an experimental fork of [work-to-markdown](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/word-to-markdown).
